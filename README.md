This repository contains the source documentation for the [about.starcatbrands.com](https://about.starcatbrands.com) documentation.

## How it's built
All pages are written in Markdown, and then run through [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) ([Insiders Edition](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/)) to generate static HTML. The resulting files are then hosted on Cloudflare Pages.

## Contributing
Since most of this documentation is specific to StarCat Brands projects, we're not actively searching for contributors. However, if you feel you have something to contribute, feel free to reach out to `aboutdot_contact@groups.starcatbrands.com`.
