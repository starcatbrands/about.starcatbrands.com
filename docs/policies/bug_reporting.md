# Responsible Bug Reporting Policy
We sincerely appreciate the work of security researchers, bug hunters, and anyone who’s willing to take the time to let us know about something that’s broken. It’s all really helpful, especially to small independent services like this one.

Please report all bugs to `bugs@starcatbrands.com`. This email address can be used for any kind of bug of any severity.

If you believe you’ve discovered a serious critical security issue, please contact `security@starcatbrands.com`. If you use PGP encryption, you can find the security PGP key to encrypt your email [:octicons-key-24: here](../contact/pgp_keys.md/#securitystarcatbrandscom). If you don't use PGP but would like to send us an encrypted message, please email `security@starcatbrands.com` for a Signal number.

Minor bugs or common annoyances can also be submitted as an issue in our ~~GitHub repository~~. This is a great way to engage in public discussion of issues (and, frankly, the public pressure is helpful for prioritizing bugfixes—seriously).

More significant bugs or security vulnerabilities should be reported via the mailboxes above. Thank you for your help with responsibly disclosing such issues.

We maintain a [:octicons-heart-24: Thank You](../general/thank_you.md) page to recognize each person who reports bugs and acknowledge their contributions.
