# Welcome

:wave: Hi there, you've found the documentation pages for (nearly) all the projects from StarCat Brands.

!!! example "Work In Progress"
    This website is still very much a work in progress. You'll certainly see unfinished pages and things that need refining. When possible, we'll mark those pages with a purple bubble like this one.

## :material-cat: About StarCat Brands
Hi! We're StarCat Brands (AKA StarCat). We're a *tiny* little team based out of Cleveland, OH.

We're making a bunch of different little projects, with a variety of uses and audiences-ranging from sound and lighting for theatre, to creators making stuff on the internet.

You can find everything we're working on, on our [:fontawesome-solid-user-astronaut: homepage](https://starcatbrand.com).

## :octicons-info-24: About This Site
